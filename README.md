# Data-Engineering-Course Projects

Welcome to the repository containing my projects for the Data Engineering course. This repository showcases the assignments and projects I developed during the semester, covering various aspects of data engineering.

## Course Description
The Data Engineering course provides a comprehensive introduction to the principles and practices of data engineering. It covers the entire lifecycle of data management, including data collection, storage, processing, and analysis. Throughout the course, students learn to design and implement efficient data pipelines, work with large-scale data systems, and apply best practices for data governance and security.
